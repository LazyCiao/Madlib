Madlib Python

The game prompts the user to input various parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
These inputted words are then inserted into a pre-written story template, creating a new, unique story. 
The user can then read the completed story and have fun with the silly and unexpected results created by the randomly chosen words.

The game uses Python to handle input and output, as well as to insert the user's words into the story template. 
The game also includes basic error handling, such as ensuring that the user enters a valid word or phrase for each part of speech.

Overall, this simple Mad Libs game is a fun and easy way to experiment with creative word combinations and enjoy the unexpected results.
